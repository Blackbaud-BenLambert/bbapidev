Returns a paginated list of constituents.
<p />
Certain parameters affect sorting:
<p />
<ul>
    <li>last_modified: Sorts in the order the constituents were last modified, ascending.</li>
    <li>sort_token: Sorts in the order the constituents were last modified, ascending.</li>
    <li>date_added: Sorts in the order the constituents were added, ascending.</li>
</ul>
<p />
The above list denotes sort precedence. Example: when both last_modified and date_added parameters are specified, the list is sorted in the order the constituents were last modified. Example 2: when both sort_token and date_added parameters are specified, the list is sorted in the order the constituents were last modified.
<p />
If no parameters are specified, the list is ordered by name (<i>last name</i> for individuals, <i>organization name</i> for organizations).
